\section{Introduction}
Freight transportation plays an increasingly important role because of rapid development of e-commerce. Carriers are facing tremendous pressure from growing competition and start to pay more attention to optimize their transportation network. Service network design (SND) formulations address issues related to the tactical planning for consolidation-based freight transportation systems. Specifically, such formulations make decisions on selecting transportation services and distributing origin-destination (O-D) commodity flow. Network links represent services with operational assets (e.g. vehicles, crews, power units) in SND formulations. Asset management concentrates on the operation and schedule of assets which require balance at each terminal in order to be available for services.

%1. heterogeneous fleet; 2. large-scale;
Most researchers assume that transportation system is provided services by homogenous assets which have the same property. Nevertheless, it is a common practice to employ heterogeneous fleet in transportation and logistics management for carriers. In the literature, only a small amount of efforts are devoted to considering heterogeneous fleet, e.g. \cite{Kim1999Multimodal} and \cite{li2017design}. Moveover, with the improvement of logistics infrastructure, carriers are confronted with increasingly huge transportation network. Since service network design problem is NP-hard, it is difficult to find a feasible solution of large-scale instance. Therefore, there is an urgent need for efficient algorithms to reduce costs for carriers in real-life application.

Our goal of this paper is to address this issue related to heterogeneous assets and take vehicles as an example to formulate service network design problem. Furthermore, a hybrid algorithm combining both exact and heuristics techniques is introduced to obtain high-quality feasible solutions efficiently. Meanwhile, the proposed algorithm provides tight lower bounds for each instance to evaluate the solutions.

The outline of this paper is as follows. In \autoref{review}, a brief literature review is elaborated. We describe the problem and propose both arc-based and cycle-path formulations in \autoref{formulation}. \autoref{method} is devoted to the proposed hybrid algorithm, whereas experimental results is presented in \autoref{experiment}. Concluding remarks is given in \autoref{conclusion}.

\section{Literature review}\label{review}
% 1.asset management 2.arc, cycle structure models 3.large-scale 4.heterogenerous fleets
Service network design contains the tactical planning decisions on selecting transportation services to satisfy O-D demands which is generally formulated as fixed-cost capacitated multicommodity network design problem (CMND), see \cite{Magnanti1984Network}, \cite{Minoux1989Networks}. In addition to scheduling services and distributing flow, asset management is marginally considered in \cite{Crainic2000Service}, \cite{Smilowitz2002Deferred} and \cite{crainic2003long}. Since carriers attach increasing importance to utilize assets economically and efficiently, SND with asset management attracts increasing attention in the literature \citep{Andersen2009bService,Teypaz2010A}.   Afterwards design-balanced constraints are proposed by \cite{Pedersen2009Models}, which state that the number of assets entering each terminal must equal the number of leaving. The design-balanced constraints induce a cyclic structure for the assets movements to complete service operations and flow distribution.

With respect to the way of formulating SND, it is general to propose arc-based formulations in the literature. While \cite{Andersen2009bService} present four alternative formulations and analyze strengths and weaknesses of each formulation. The experimental results show that formulations based on cycle variables outperform other formulations in both solution quality and time. However, the amount of generated cycles grows exponentially and requires more efficient enumeration algorithm. Consequently, \cite{Andersen2011Branch} propose an efficient branch-and-price scheme for the cycle-based formulation to avoid the enumeration of cycles. Their algorithm contains two subproblems for the dynamical construction of paths for commodities and cycles for vehicles.

Since the SND problem is NP-hard, heuristic methods are preferred choices with respect to the large scale of instances. \cite{Pedersen2009Models} present a two-phase tabu search meta-heuristic framework for the arc-based formulation. The proposed algorithm includes exploration phase to build neighborhoods and feasibility phase to implement an infeasibility-monitoring procedure for reaching good feasible solutions. \cite{Teypaz2010A} present a three-step decomposition heuristic to solve large-scale freight transportation formulation and build comprehensive solutions for real-life size instances. \cite{VuDucToulouse} propose a three-phase meta-heuristic method combining neighbourhood-based and exact methods. Additionally, computational results on large-scale benchmark instances indicate the efficiency of the algorithm. Another meta-heuristic combining a cutting-plane scheme to obtain lower bound and a variable ﬁxing procedure to cut down the dimension of the problem is introduced in \cite{Chouman2015Cutting}. \cite{Crainic2016Service} propose a new service network design model with resource constraints and design a solution approach combining column generation and slope scaling methods to find high-quality solutions.

 Only a single asset type is considered in the aforementioned literature. As for heterogeneous assets, especially multiple types of vehicles, \cite{Kim1999Multimodal} introduce three different formulations and two sets of valid inequalities. However, no efficient algorithm is mentioned to solve those formulations in that paper. \cite{li2017design} propose a tabu search based meta-heuristic to solve arc-based formulation for design-balanced capacitated multicommodity network design with heterogeneous vehicles. The amounts of each type of vehicle used by each service are not decided explicitly in their paper. And the scale of those experimental instances solved by the proposed algorithm cannot satisfy the real-life demand.

Our research makes the following contributions to the literature: First, we present both arc-based and cycle-path formulations for service network design considering heterogeneous fleet. Second, a hybrid algorithm including column generation, cutting plane and local search methods is introduced. Moreover, the proposed algorithm provides high-quality both lower bounds and feasible solutions for large-scale instances efficiently.

\section{Problem statement and model formulation}\label{formulation}
In this section, we describe the problem mathematically and propose two equivalent formulations based on arc and cycle-path respectively.

\subsection{Problem description}
Since most literature assume homogeneous fleet is employed which may not accord with the common practices, we take heterogeneous fleet into consideration in this paper. The example network with heterogeneous fleet operating is shown in \autoref{Fig1}. Under this assumption, the amount of different type of vehicles should be decided on each arc. In \autoref{Fig1}, there two types of fleet providing services and arcs in solid line are labeled by the amount of specific type of vehicles. At each node the numbers of same type of vehicle entering and leaving equals. A cycle consists of a sequence of arcs satisfying design-balance requirements of the same type of vehicle, e.g., $\{ (A,D),(D,C),(C,B),(B,A) \}$. A path starts at the origin of a commodity and ends at its destination. Suppose there is a commodity with origin $A$ and destination $G$, thus $\{ (A,D),(D,G) \}$ and $\{ (A,D),(D,F),(F,G) \}$ are two paths. Note that arc $(A,D)$ employs both two types of vehicles to provide transportation services.

\begin{figure}[H]

\caption{Example of heterogeneous fleet}
\label{Fig1}
\end{figure}

Given a directed graph $G=(N,A)$ with node set $N$ and arc set $A$. Each commodity $k$ in commodity set $K$ has a known demand $d^k$ to be transited from its origin node $o(k)$ to destination node $d(k)$. Let $F$ denote the set of fleet types and each type $f\in F$ has a certain capacity $u^f$.

\subsection{Arc-based formulation}
Let  $h_{ij}^f$ denote the fixed cost of utilizing fleet type $f\in F$ with respect to arc $(i,j)$. The unit flow cost for transporting commodity $k\in K$ on arc $(i,j)$ is denoted $c_{ij}^k$. The capacity of fleet type $f$ is denoted by $u^f$. We define $N_i^+:\{j\in N:(i,j)\in A\},N_i^-:\{j\in N:(j,i)\in A\}$. For each commodity $k$ and node $i$, define
\begin{equation*}
\omega_i^k= \left\{
\begin{aligned}
d^k&  & if \ i=o(k) \\
-d^k&  & if \ i=d(k) \\
0&  & otherwise
\end{aligned}
\right.
\end{equation*}

Two sets of decision variables are defined as follows.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Continuous variable: $x_{ij}^k$ represents the amount of flow with respect to commodity $k\in K$ on arc $(i,j)\in A$;
  \item Integer variable: $y_{ij}^f$ denotes the amount of fleet type $f\in F$ that provide transportation services on arc $(i,j)\in A$.
\end{itemize}

The model is formulated as follows:
\begin{align}
  \min &  \sum_{f\in F}\sum_{(i,j)\in A}h_{ij}^f y_{ij}^f + \sum_{k\in K}\sum_{(i,j)\in A} c_{ij}^k x_{ij}^k   \label{objA}  \\
  \rm{s.t.} \nonumber  \\
         &  \sum_{j\in N_i^+}x_{ij}^k - \sum_{j\in N_i^-}x_{ji}^k = w_i^k     \quad     \forall i\in N, \forall k\in K,     \label{demandA}  \\
         &   \sum_{j\in N_i^+}y_{ij}^f - \sum_{j\in N_i^-}y_{ji}^f = 0  \quad     \forall i\in N, \forall f\in F,   \label{dbA} \\
         &   \sum_{k\in K}x_{ij}^k \leq \sum_{f\in F}u^f y_{ij}^f  \quad  \forall (i,j)\in A,   \label{capacityA} \\
         &    x_{ij}^k \geq 0  \quad  \forall (i,j)\in A, \forall k\in K,   \label{xA} \\
         &   y_{ij}^f \in Z_0^+  \quad  \forall (i,j)\in A,\forall f\in F, \label{yA}
\end{align}

The objective function (\ref{objA}) minimizes the sum of the fixed costs for selecting and operating transportation service with respect to heterogeneous fleet and the total commodity flow costs. Constrains (\ref{demandA}) represent the flow conversation relations for each node and each commodity. Equations (\ref{dbA}) are the design-balance constraints, which ensure the same number of each type of vehicle entering and leaving a node. Through constrains (\ref{capacityA}), we enforce the total flow cannot exceed the total capacity provided by all vehicles on each arc. Finally, variable-type restrictions appear in constrains (\ref{xA}) and (\ref{yA}).

\subsection{Cycle-path formulation}
Let $Q^f$ represent the set of all design cycle with respect to fleet type $f\in F$. And we define the set of all paths with respect to commodity $k\in K$ as $P^k$. Two sets of decision variables are given as follows.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Cycle integer variables: $y_q^f$ denotes the amount of vehicle type $f$ used by cycle $q\in Q^f$;
  \item Path continuous variables: $x_p^k$ denotes the volume of commodity $k$ on path $p\in P^k$.
\end{itemize}
We define two set of indicator variables:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $\alpha_{ij}^q$: equals 1 if arc $(i,j)$ is included in cycle $q$, and 0 otherwise;
  \item $\delta_{ij}^p$: equals 1 if arc $(i,j)$ is included in path $p$, and 0 otherwise.
\end{itemize}

The fixed cost of cycle $q$ with respect to fleet type $f$ is denoted $h_q^f$, which equals $\sum_{(i,j)\in A} h_{ij}^f \alpha_{ij}^q$. Similarly, the flow cost of path $p$ with respect to commodity $k$ is denoted $c_p^k$, which equals $\sum_{(i,j)\in A} c_{ij}^k \delta_{ij}^p$.
\begin{align}
  \min &    \sum_{f\in F}\sum_{q\in Q^f}h_q^f y_q^f  +   \sum_{k\in K}\sum_{p\in P^k}c_p^k x_p^k  \label{objCP}    \\
         & \rm{s.t.} \nonumber \\
         &     \sum_{k\in K}\sum_{p\in P^k}\delta_{ij}^p x_p^k \leq  \sum_{f\in F}\sum_{q\in Q^f}u^f \alpha_{ij}^q y_q^f      \quad \forall (i,j)\in A \label{capacityCP}\\
         &     \sum_{p\in P^k}x_p^k = d^k      \quad       \forall k\in K  \label{demandCP}    \\
         &      x_p^k \geq 0        \quad       \forall p\in P^k,\forall k\in K     \label{xCP} \\
         &      y_q^f \in Z_0^+     \quad       \forall q\in Q^f, \forall f\in F    \label{yCP}
\end{align}

The objective function (\ref{objCP}) minimizes the total cost calculated as the sum of the flow costs on paths plus the fixed costs for selected cycles with respect to specific type of vehicle.Through constrains (\ref{capacityCP}), we enforce service capacity restrictions on each arc. Constrains (\ref{demandCP}) ensure demand satisfaction corresponding to the flow conservation equations for each commodity. Finally, Constrains (\ref{xCP}) and (\ref{yCP}) gives variable-type restrictions.

\section{Solution method}\label{method}
Since the service network design problem is NP-hard, the exact algorithm is difficult to solve the large-scale instances optimally. Heuristics and metaheuristics are the preferred choices in real-life application. But the drawback of heuristics algorithm is that the results cannot be evaluated by lower bounds. Therefore we propose a hybrid method combining the exact and the heuristics algorithm to solve the problem. The exact part mainly contains column generation and cutting plane method to obtain tight lower bounds. Moreover, we employ the linear solution provided by column-and-cut generation approach as a good neighborhood and use local search techniques to find better feasible solutions. The sketch of the proposed hybrid algorithm is shown in \autoref{Methodology}.

\subsection{Column-and-cut generation (C\&CG)}
The column generation approach has been proved to be efficient to solve cycle-path formulation by \cite{Andersen2011Branch}. With respect to cutting-plane procedure, it is also proved to be effective in calculating tight lower bounds for CMND-related problems, see \cite{Chouman2009Commodity,Chouman2016Commodity,Chouman2015Cutting}. We combine the methods to strengthen lower bounds for the proposed formulations.

\subsubsection{Column generation (CG)}
The linear relaxation of the cycle-path formulation constitutes the master problem(MP) which is solved by the CG approach. Since the number of variables in the MP is exponentially increasing, it is necessary to concentrate on a restricted master problem(RMP) which contains only a subset of variables(columns) in the MP.  The CG approach starts with some necessary cycles and paths to prevent the constraints violation. We generate one path for each commodity to ensure its O-D demand. A reversed path from the destination of each commodity to its origin is combined with the former path to constitute a cycle. Therefore, we add a path and a cycle for each commodity as the initial columns to ensure the RMP feasible. The method adds new paths and cycles dynamically to the RMP until no additional column with negative reduced cost can be found.

The dual variable values in the solution of the RMP are past on to the subproblem for generating new columns. Dual variables $\eta_{ij}$ and $\sigma_k$ are associated with constraints (\ref{capacityCP}) and (\ref{demandCP}) respectively. The reduced cost associated with cycle-related variable $y_q^f$ and path-related variable $x_p^k$ is given by:
\begin{align}
& RC_{fq} = h_q^f + \sum_{(i,j)\in A} u^f \alpha_{ij}^q \eta_{ij} = \sum_{(i,j)\in q} (h_{ij}^f + u^f \eta_{ij}) \\
& RP_{kp} = c_p^k - \sum_{(i,j)\in A} \delta_{ij}^p \eta_{ij} - \sigma_k = \sum_{(i,j)\in p} (c_{ij}^k - \eta_{ij}) - \sigma_k
\end{align}

We search for cycles and paths with negative reduced cost and add them to the RMP. The column generation procedure is presented in \autoref{CG}. When searching for the shortest cycle, we add a virtual node which is as same as the starting node as the destination node. Such that we can use the shortest path algorithm to find the shortest cycle. Note that dual variable $\eta_{ij} \leq 0$, then the arc costs may be negative when searching for the shortest cycle. Therefore, we employ the label-correcting algorithm implemented by \cite{Ahuja1993Network} to identify the shortest path.

            add the corresponding path to the RMP\;
        }
    }
}
%\KwOut{best feasible solution}
\end{algorithm}

\subsubsection{Cutting plane}
The cutting plane procedure employs the generation of valid inequalities to strengthen the lower bound in relatively short time comparing with state-of-the-art software. We introduce two sets of valid inequalities including strong inequalities and cutset inequalities. Strong inequalities(SI) have been widely used to improve the quality of the LP lower bound, see \cite{Gendron1994RELAXATIONS,Gendron1999Multicommodity} and \cite{Chouman2015Cutting}. We extend SI to be suitable for the proposed formulations in our paper which are defined in inequalities (\ref{SI}). The main effects of SI is to restrict the flow of every commodity on an arc with no fleet to be 0.
\begin{align}\label{SI}
  x_{ij}^k \leq d^k \sum_{f\in F} y_{ij}^f      \quad       \forall (i,j)\in A, \forall k\in K.
\end{align}

Cutset inequalities(CI) have been used by \cite{Chouman2015Cutting} to strengthen the lower bound for the DBCMND. As for the circumstance of considering heterogeneous fleet, CI have been presented by \cite{Kim1999Multimodal} which are defined as
\begin{align}
    \sum_{f\in F}u^f Y_{S,\bar{S}}^f \geq  D_{S,\bar{S}}
\end{align}

where we define cutset $(S,\bar{S})$ by partitioning the node set $N$ into any nonempty subset $S$ and its complement $\bar{S}=N\backslash S$. An arc $(i,j)$ that connects node $i$ in $S$ to node $j$ in $\bar{S}$  belongs to the cutset $(S,\bar{S})$. Let $Y_{S,\bar{S}}^f$ denote the total amount of type $f$ vehicles used on the cutset $(S,\bar{S})$ arcs, i.e., $\sum_{(i,j)\in (S,\bar{S})} y_{ij}^f$ for the arc-based formulation and $\sum_{q\in Q^f}\sum_{(i,j)\in (S,\bar{S})} \alpha_{ij}^q y_q^f $ for the cycle-path formulation. Let $D_{S,\bar{S}}$ denote the aggregate demand of all commodities with their origin in$S$ and destination in $\bar{S}$. CI ensure the total demand that must flow from $S$ to $\bar{S}$ will be satisfied by enough capacity on the arcs of $(S,\bar{S})$. In general, the LP solution will not violate CI. Therefore, we lift CI by using a integer rounding procedure to produce $Chv\acute{a}tal$-$Gomory$ (C-G) cuts which are proved to be valid by \cite{Kim1999Multimodal}. The impact of adding cuts on the pricing problem is negligible, thus there is no need to modify arc costs.
\begin{align}
  \sum_{f\in F} \left( \left \lceil \frac{u_f}{u_l} \right \rceil Y_{S,\bar{S}}^f  \right)  \geq \left\lceil \frac{D_{S,\bar{S}}}{u_l} \right\rceil  \quad   \forall l\in F
\end{align}
The challenge in using cutset inequalities is the large number of potential cutsets, it is impractical to enumerate all the associated inequalities. Moveover, it becomes more computationally expensive to lift the inequalities as the scale of the problem increases. Therefore, we only generate single-node cutset inequalities, see \cite{Chouman2016Commodity} for the details.

The dynamic generation of valid inequalities is embedded in the column generation approach. Once there exist violated cuts, column generation procedure is executed again. The price-and-cut loop stops only if neither negative reduced cost columns nor violated cuts are found.

\subsection{Local search}
Based on the linear solution obtained from C\&CG approach, we consider it as a good neighborhood to search for better solutions. Furthermore, since the application of SND employing heterogeneous fleet by logistics enterprises will deal with large-scale network, it is necessary to present efficient algorithms to find high-quality solutions efficiently. Therefore, we propose a two-stage local search algorithm to find feasible solutions.

After we obtain the lower bound, the CG and cutting plane method will provide the value of $\bar{x}_{ij}^k$ and $\bar{y}_{ij}^f$. Then define the arc subset including arcs with nonzero flow as $A_1$, i.e., $A_1 = \{ (i,j)\in A : \sum_{k\in K} \bar{x}_{ij}^k >0 \} $, and another arc subset including arcs with nonzero fleets as $A_2$, i.e., $A_2 =\{  (i,j)\in A : \sum_{f\in F} \bar{y}_{ij}^f >0 \}$. It is easy to find that $A_1\subseteq A_2 \subseteq A$ because of the capacity constraints. The first stage satisfies O-D demands and determines flows on each arc $(i,j)\in A_1$. The second stage ensures the balance of fleets and provides enough capacity for flows on each arc $(i,j)\in A_2$. The corresponding formulations in two stages are defined as follows.

\subsubsection{Stage 1: flow distribution problem}
Without taking service selection and fleet assignment into account, the formulation of flow distribution problem is actually a capacitated multi-commodity minimum cost flow problem (CMCF). The values of $\sum_{(i,j)\in A_2}u^f \bar{y}_{ij}^f $ decide the arc capacity $u_{ij}$ in $A_1$.
\begin{align}
   \min& \sum_{(i,j)\in A_1}\sum_{k\in K} c_{ij}^k x_{ij}^k     \\
   \rm{s.t.} & \nonumber \\
         &  \sum_{j\in N_i^+}x_{ij}^k - \sum_{j\in N_i^-}x_{ji}^k = w_i^k     \quad      \forall i\in N, \forall k\in K,  \\
         &  \sum_{k\in K} x_{ij}^k \leq u_{ij}      \quad    \forall (i,j)\in A_1,  \\
        &  x_{ij}^k \geq 0   \quad    \forall (i,j)\in A_1, \forall k\in K.
\end{align}

After solving the CMCF and redistributing the flow on each arc, the arcs without flow are removed from $A_1$, i.e., $A_1 = A_1 \backslash  \{ (i,j)\in A_1 : \sum_{k\in K} x_{ij}^k =0 \}$.

\subsubsection{Stage 2: fleet assignment problem}
Once completing the flow distribution and satisfying the demands of all O-D commodities, we need to assign heterogeneous fleet to provide transportation services. Let $\Omega_{ij}$ be the total flow of all commodities distributed on arc $(i,j) \in A_2$, which equals $\sum_{k\in K}x_{ij}^k$ provided by solving CMCF in the first stage. The mathematical formulation of Stage 2 defined on arc set $A_2$ is as follow:
\begin{align}
  \min & \sum_{f\in F}\sum_{(i,j)\in A_2} h_{ij}^f y_{ij}^f \\
    \rm{s.t.} & \nonumber \\
     & \sum_{j\in N_i^+}y_{ij}^f - \sum_{j\in N_i^-}y_{ji}^f = 0     \quad      \forall i\in N,\forall f\in F  \\
     & \sum_{f\in F} u^f y_{ij}^f \geq \Omega_{ij}      \quad       \forall (i,j)\in A_2   \label{cap} \\
     & y_{ij}^f \in Z_0^+       \quad       \forall (i,j)\in A_2, \forall f\in F
\end{align}

Constraints (\ref{cap}) ensure each service arc will provide sufficient vehicle capacity for the total flow.

\subsubsection{Cycle-based neighborhoods}
After the two formulations are solved, we obtain a feasible solution of the original problem. The quality of the feasible solution depends on the two arc subsets $A_1$ and $A_2$. To find promising $A_1$ and $A_2$, we introduce cycle-based neighborhoods to search for better feasible solutions. The cycle-based neighborhoods have been presented and proved to be efficient when solving CMND-related problems, see \cite{Ghamlouche2003Cycle, Ghamlouche2004Path,li2017design}.

The cycle-based neighborhoods aim at redirecting flow on one path to another, and exploring the space of arc subsets $A_1$ and $A_2$ through opening or closing some arcs. To illustrate, consider the partial network in \autoref{cycle}, there is a cycle formed by paths $\{ (A,B),(B,C),(C,F) \}$ and $\{ (A,E),(E,F)\}$. If we redirect the flow from the former to the latter, a new solution will be generated by opening arcs $(A,E),(E,F)$ and closing empty arcs $(A,B),(B,C),(C,F)$. The procedure of finding a cycle-based neighborhood can be summarized as follows.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Identify a cycle containing two paths connecting two points.
  \item Redirect the flow from one path to another and ensure that at least one open arc becomes empty.
  \item Open all formerly closed arcs in the cycle and close all formerly open arcs if they are empty after the flow redirection.
\end{itemize}

It is very important to implement an efficient procedure to find a promising neighborhood since complete evaluation of all moves is not practical, especially facing huge networks. Note that since we have to close at least one previously open arc, it seems suitable to start from a nonempty open arc $(i^*,j^*)$ with $\gamma = \sum_{k\in K} x_{i^*j^*}^k$ units of flow. Since the arc $(i^*,j^*)$ will be closed after the flow redirection, the residual capacity of any cycle associated with $(i^*,j^*)$ must be at least $\gamma$. A residual network must be built to efficiently search for low-cost cycles corresponding to promising moves without exhaustive exploration and exact evaluation.

To build such a residual network associated to $(i^*,j^*)$ and $\gamma$ units of flow redirection, we include two types of arc sets in the new network, one with positive arc cost and the other with negative arc cost. Each arc in the original network will be replaced by at most two arcs $(i,j)^+$ and $(j,i)^-$ from the two arc sets respectively. Define $\bar{c}_{ij}$ as the average flow cost on arc $(i,j)$, i.e. $\bar{c}_{ij} = \sum_{k\in K} c_{ij}^k / |K|$. Let $\bar{F}$ denote the average fixed cost to evaluate the impact of fleet assignment because of opening or closing an arc, which equals $\sum_{f\in F}h_{ij}^f/ |F|$.

Arc $(i,j)^+$ will be included in the residual network if the residual capacity of arc $(i,j)$ is no less than $\gamma$, i.e. $ u_{ij} - \sum_{k\in K} x_{ij}^k \geq \gamma$. The cost $c_{ij}^+$ corresponding to $(i,j)^+$ approximates the additional cost of distribute $\gamma$ units of flow on arc $(i,j)$. It is calculated as the additional flow cost, plus the average fixed cost if arc $(i,j)$ is closed at present, i.e. $(i,j) \notin A_2$.
\begin{equation*}
c_{ij}^+ = \left\{
\begin{aligned}
&\bar{c}_{ij} \gamma + \bar{F}  & & if\ (i,j) \notin A_2, \\
&\bar{c}_{ij} \gamma                 & & otherwise.
\end{aligned}
\right.
\end{equation*}

Since arc $(j,i)^-$ is employed to represent flow reduction on arc $(i,j)$, it will be included in the residual network only if the current flow on $(i,j)$ is no less than $\gamma$. Symmetrically, the cost $c_{ji}^-$ associated to $(j,i)^-$ approximates the reduced cost of decreasing $\gamma$ units of flow on arc $(i,j)$. It is calculated as the reduced flow cost, minus the average fixed cost if arc $(i,j)$ will be empty after reduction of $\gamma$ units of flow.
\begin{equation*}
c_{ji}^- = \left\{
\begin{aligned}
&-\bar{c}_{ij} \gamma - \bar{F}  &if \ & \sum_{k\in K} x_{ij}^k = \gamma, \\
&-\bar{c}_{ij} \gamma                  &if \ &\sum_{k\in K} x_{ij}^k > \gamma.
\end{aligned}
\right.
\end{equation*}

Such a residual network aims at identifying a lowest-cost cycle containing arc $(i^*,j^*)$ to redirect $\gamma$ units of flow. Moreover, it takes into account the influence of opening or closure of arcs to search for better feasible solutions. To illustrate how to find the lowest-cost cycle in the residual network, consider the network example of \autoref{NetworkExample}. Suppose arc $(A,B)$ is the candidate arc to be closed, the residual network associated with $(A,B)$ is shown in \autoref{NetworkExample}. The average flow costs of all arcs in the example are assumed to be 2, and the average fixed cost $\bar{F}$ is 3. Arcs in the residual network are labeled by their costs. Note that there are two cycles associated with arc $(A,B)$: $(A,E),(E,F),(F,C),(C,B),(B,A)$ and $(A,E),(E,B),(B,A)$. The two cycles have costs of -7, 4,respectively. Since the former has the lowest cost, 2 units of flow are moved from path $(A,B),(B,C),(C,F)$ to path $(A,E),(E,F)$. Therefore, a new neighborhood is obtained by opening arcs $(A,E),(E,F)$ and closing empty arcs $(A,B),(B,C),(C,F)$.

\subsubsection{Main local search loop}
Since each new neighborhood is associated with a candidate arc, let $A^+$ denote the candidate arcs, which equals $\{ (i,j)\in A: \sum_{k\in K} x_{ij}^k > 0 \}$. With respect to each arc $(i^*,j^*)$ in $A^+$, we build a residual network and find the shortest path from $i^*$ to $j^*$ to complete the cycle. We still employ the label-correcting algorithm implemented by \cite{Ahuja1993Network} to identify the shortest path.

Note that the closure of some arcs may lead to infeasible neighboring solutions. Therefore it is necessary to check whether at least one path links the origin and destination of each commodity before comparing the cycle cost. Although it can not ensure the feasibility of the first stage when solving the flow distribution problem, it still decreases the appearance of infeasible local search moves.

Once the lowest cost cycle is found, $A_1$ is updated by the move including opening and closure of some arcs. Then we solve the flow distribution problem and update $A_1$ again by closing empty arcs. Before solving the fleet assignment problem, $A_2$ is updated by $A_1 \cup A_2$. If the two stages are both feasible, we obtain a feasible solution of the original formulation. Furthermore, $A_1$ and $A_2$ in the next iteration are determined by this feasible solution. To explore more extensive search space, we assign a tabu status to the arc associated with the feasible move. The local search approach terminates if either of the two stages is infeasible or the maximum iteration is reached. The sketch of the local search algorithm is shown in \autoref{LS}.

\section{Numerical experiments and analyses}\label{experiment}
The computation study is implemented in C++, using CPLEX 12.63 as the linear programming solver. All experiments are performed using a computer with four 64-bit 2.4 GHz Intel Core processors and 4 GB of RAM, operating under Windows 10. Computing time are reported in seconds.

\subsection{Data instances}
Since there are no suitable instances available in the literature, we randomly generate 30 large-scale instances based on the classic network instance sets described in \cite{crainic2001bundle} and used in several papers (\cite{Ghamlouche2003Cycle,Pedersen2009Models} and \cite{Chouman2015Cutting}). The arc flow cost is an integer randomly generated in the interval [2,7]. The demand of each commodity is generated over [2,15]. The capacity and fixed cost of each type of fleet is a random number in the interval [2,15] and [100,300] respectively. Each instance is characterized by its number of fleet types, nodes, commodities and arcs, noted $|F|\in \{5,10\}$, $|N|\in \{30,35,40\}$, $|K|\in \{200,300,400\}$ and $|A|\in \{600,800\}$, respectively.

\subsection{Parameter setting}
During the process of computing lower bound, to avoid instability, we use the CPLEX recommended value, a tolerance of $10^{-6}$ for relative change in objective function value in the column generation. That is, columns will be added only if their reduced costs is less than $-10^{-6}$.

%max iteration of local search
As for the maximum iteration of local search algorithm, we choose instance 15 and instance 23 which is listed in \autoref{results} in detail to illustrate the evolution of solution values. And as we can see from \autoref{Evolution}, the improvement tendency of the solution value become weak near 50 iterations. Therefore, we set the maximum iteration as 50. Furthermore, we find it easy to obtain a good solution in a short time when solving the second stage in local search procedure, there is no need to solving the second stage optimally. Therefore the fleet assignment problem is solved by CPLEX with a time limit of 30 seconds.

\subsection{Computational results}
The scope of the section is to evaluate the performance of the proposed solution method. In particular, We compare the results with CPLEX running 10 hours of CPU time to show clearly the effectiveness and efficiency in strengthening the lower bounds and finding high-quality feasible solutions. The comparison results with respect to 30 large-scale instances are shown in \autoref{results}. Without loss of generality, the values of all lower bound, upper bound and computing time are round to integers to show in \autoref{results}.

The lower bounds and upper bounds obtained by CPLEX running 10 hours of CPU time are shown in Column LB$_1$ and UB$_1$. Let GAP$_1$ denote the percentage gap between LB$_1$ and UB$_1$, which is calculated as $\rm \frac{UB_1 - LB_1}{UB_1}\times 100$. The lower bounds, total number of cuts and total computing time obtained by column-and-cut generation approach are displayed in column LB$_2$, Cuts and T$_1$, respectively. The percentage gap between LB$_1$ and LB$_2$ is shown in column GAP$_2$, which is calculated as $\rm \frac{LB_2 - LB_1}{LB_2}\times 100$. Column UB$_2$ and T$_2$ display the upper bounds and computing time of local search approach. Column GAP$_3$ denotes the percentage gap between UB$_1$ and UB$_2$, i.e., $\rm \frac{UB_2 - UB_1}{UB_2}\times 100$. The last column GAP$_4$ shows the percentage gap between UB$_2$ and LB$_2$, which is calculated as $\rm \frac{UB_2 - LB_2}{UB_2}\times 100$.

We calculate the distribution of four relative percentage gaps in \autoref{results} and show the results in \autoref{distributions}. GAP$_1$ and GAP$_4$ are the results obtained by CPLEX and the proposed hybrid algorithm with respect to 30 instances. The gaps of most instances are more than 50 when solved by CPLEX, by contrast, the gaps of most instances are between 10 and 20 when solved by the proposed hybrid algorithm. In general, CPLEX achieves relative gap by an average percentage of 50.90 after 10 hours of CPU time. However, the proposed hybrid algorithm achieves relative gap by an average percentage of 18.14 and only takes 2124 seconds averagely.

\autoref{results} displays the performance of column-and-cut generation approach with respect to lower bound. Comparing with CPLEX running 10 hours, the C\&CG approach find better lower bound in very short time. The values of GAP$_2$ being positive means C\&CG approach can find tighter lower bounds. In general, this approach achieves stronger lower bounds by an average percentage of 2.34 and only takes 563 seconds averagely. This could signify the efficiency of C\&CG method in searching for promising columns to reduce the problem size. Then the cuts are added to strengthen the lower bound by identifying violated valid inequalities. Although the improvements are not significantly, it is still impressive considering the computing time. It only takes hundreds of seconds to outperform CPLEX running 10 hours.

\subsubsection{Evaluation of the local search approach}
The results with respect to local search approach demonstrate its efficiency in searching for high-quality solutions for large-scale instances, which are illustrated in \autoref{results}. The improvements calculated through GAP$_3$ of several instances may exceed one hundred percentage. In general, this approach improves the upper bounds by an average percentage of -72.29 and only takes 1561 seconds averagely. The distribution of GAP$_3$ in \autoref{distributions} displays the significant improvement of upper bound by local search approach.

\autoref{threeUB} shows the comparative upper bounds of CPLEX and local search approach. We display both the initial solution values at the first iteration and the best solution values obtained by local search approach. A majority of the initial solution values line is under the line of the best solution value by CPLEX. Therefore, it confirms that the linear solutions obtained by C\&CG approach provide good neighborhood for local search approach to find high-quality initial solutions.

\subsubsection{Impact of heterogeneous fleet issue}
This section aims to examine the impact of heterogeneous fleet and demonstrate its necessity. In this respect, two small-scale test instances which can be solved optimally by CPLEX are randomly generated. Different amounts of fleet types provide transportation services over the two network. We generate multiple combinations for each certain amount of fleet types and take an average as the total cost. Main parameters of these networks and average total costs are shown in \autoref{heterogeneous}.

We employ \autoref{twoNetwork} to intuitively show the change of total costs as the amount of fleet types increases. As \autoref{twoNetwork} illustrates, the diversification of fleet types reduces total cost over the same network. It is a reasonable result which accords with practical experience.

\section{Conclusions}\label{conclusion}
We address heterogeneous fleet issue about service network design problem to accord with the real-life demand of transportation carriers and present two equivalent formulations based on arc and cycle-path respectively.

A hybrid method combing exact and heuristics techniques is introduced to solve the proposed formulations. The method includes a column-and-cut generation procedure efficiently computing tight lower bounds and a local search algorithm reducing the problem size and obtaining good solutions.

The computational study indicates the merit of the proposed column-and-cut generation procedure in strengthening the lower bounds and providing a good neighborhood for the local searching heuristic to identify high-quality initial feasible solutions. The results also shows the effectiveness of cycle-based neighborhood in searching for promising solutions. Both exact and heuristic techniques are proved to outperform the state-of-the-art MIP solver CPLEX. This performance appears more remarkable when comparing the computational efforts required by identifying lower bounds and upper bounds for the large-scale instances.
